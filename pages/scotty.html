            "I never really set out to be a music teacher. My mother, a symphony violinist, started me with piano lessons when I was 6 years old. I began to learn to play the guitar in 1964, when I was 10. <span class="text-warning fw-bold">The Beatles</span> had just arrived in America - and I just <span class="fst-italic text-decoration-underline">had</span> to learn to play the guitar! From the beginning, I was the kid who *had* to know.

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">
            My piano lessons had shown me that there was <span class="text-danger fw-bold">a system to the way music worked</span>, and I knew that if I wanted to learn to play guitar, <span class="fw-bold">I would have to understand that system</span>. I wanted to write my own songs... play by ear... jam and improvise like the Beatles... but neither my private teachers or the public school music programs <span class="fw-bold">taught</span> that stuff!

            ...I tried to learn to play guitar myself. My friends would show me some chords and scales. The books I would try to read were often <span class="fw-bold">scattered</span> and <span class="fw-bold">confusing</span>. My music instructors didn't seem to know the answers. It's difficult to learn to play the guitar if there's no <span class="text-warning fw-bold">program</span> to follow. Even so, everyone thought I was this hot guitar player. I could play the popular songs of the day... Hendrix, Dylan, The Beatles... Everyone thought I was this <span class="fw-bold">hot-shot guitar player</span>, but I knew I was only faking it. I didn't have <span class="text-danger fw-bold">"The BIG Picture"</span>.

            Then one summer, my luck changed. A new roommate named <span class="text-warning fw-bold">Dan May</span> moved in with us. Dan was one of those <span class="fw-bold">true musical prodigies</span> you hear about: played the piano before he could walk... masters degree in music composition at age 22... totally knowledgeable about guitar music theory and good at explaining it clearly and logically. Dan <span class="fw-bold">understood music inside out</span>. He actually knew the answers to all the questions that I had been asking all those years! I would slap myself on the forehead and ask "Why didn't my other music teachers show me <span class="text-danger fw-bold">this stuff</span> when I was a kid?!"

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">
            Dan showed me that learning to play the guitar is easy - if you can find someone to explain it to you <span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">the right way.</span>
